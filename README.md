# Next.js Starter

Learn more in the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)

Set up using Next's [manual setup](https://nextjs.org/docs#manual-setup)

## What's inside?

### `pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`

These are the pages of the site! For instance `/about` takes you to the about page. If you want to add a page (say, `/hello`), you can create a corresponding file (in this case, `pages/hello.js`).

### `pages/_document.js`

This is a global template used to wrap and format all pages.

### `components/`

Put re-usable page components here. `components/header.js` and `components/footer.js` are the code for the shared header/footer of the pages.

### `public/`

Files in the `public` folder will be served as static files by the site. Good for images, icons, styles (like `style.css`), and page script files.

### `next.config.js`

Set options for the Next.js tooling here! For instance, the dev server adds a 'pre-rendered page' widget to pages. You can disable that here, as well as set any other tool/framework options.
